# Install Go extension in VS Code
# Search for "Go" in extensions
```

### Step 4: Create Your Learning Structure
```bash
# Create your workspace
mkdir ~/learning-go
cd ~/learning-go

# Create directories for each week
mkdir week1 week2 week3 week4
mkdir week5 week6 week7 week8
mkdir week9 week10 week11 week12

# Initialize git
git init
git remote add origin [your-github-repo]
```

### Step 5: Start Day 1!
- Set a daily alarm for your 1-hour study session

- Review what you learned
- Check the practice exercises

### Minutes 35-60: Practice (Hands-On)
- Complete the day's practice exercises

## 📝 How to Use the Main Learning Plan

### The Plan Structure:
```
Each day includes:
- **Theory (30min)** - Topics to cover in your Udemy course
- **Practice (30min)** - Specific coding exercises
- **Self-Check** - Questions to verify understanding
```

### Your Job:
1. **Read the theory topics** listed for each day
2. **Find those topics** in your Udemy course curriculum
3. **Watch the relevant lectures** (should be 10-15 min of video)
4. **Complete the practice exercises** provided in the plan

### Example Mapping:
```
Plan says:
Day 2: Variables, Types & Constants
Theory Topics:
- Variables and declarations
- Basic types
- Type inference
- Constants

Your Course might have:
Section 2: "Go Basics"
├─ Lecture 5: Variables in Go
├─ Lecture 6: Understanding Types
├─ Lecture 7: Type Inference
└─ Lecture 8: Working with Constants

→ Watch these lectures for Day 2!
```

## 🎯 Key Success Tips

### 1. **Consistency Over Intensity**
- 1 hour daily > 7 hours on Sunday
- Missing a day? Just continue the next day
- Don't try to "catch up" by cramming

### 2. **Active Learning**
- Always type the code yourself
- Don't copy-paste
- Make mistakes and fix them
- Experiment with variations

### 3. **Build Projects**
- Every project in the plan should be built
- Push everything to GitHub
- These become your portfolio

### 4. **Ask Questions**
- Use Udemy course Q&A
- Join r/golang on Reddit
- Use Stack Overflow
- Don't stay stuck for hours

### 5. **Track Your Progress**
Create a simple checklist:
```markdown
## Week 1
- [ ] Day 1: Setup Complete
- [ ] Day 2: Variables Mastered
- [ ] Day 3: Functions Done
- [ ] Day 4: Control Flow Done
- [ ] Day 5: Loops Done
- [ ] Day 6: Arrays/Slices Done
- [ ] Day 7: Project Complete
```
